## Story about project📖 

This purchase for was an exam of my university, made with the basic web tools. HTML and JavaScript. Also, we added bootstrap for the view. I did to use that because, at that moment, it was faster than use CSS only.
In the classroom, we only did have two hours to do the exam. I did get 10/10 🥳🍾
